\#\#Introduction

\hypertarget{i-background-information}{%
\subsubsection{(i) Background
Information}\label{i-background-information}}

Racial profiling in policing has always been a huge point of contention.
It is defined as police practice that relies on certain racial
characteristics they believe to be associated with crime. This issue is
especially prominent in selective policing strategies such as
``stop-and-frisk'', i.e.~deciding which pedestrains to search, question,
or frisk, a program in New York City that has caused numerous civil
rights controversies. Police have defended the strategy by claiming
that, while stop-rates are higher for non-white citizens, it only
reflects reasonable prior knowledge or experience such as historic crime
rates by race, or that other counfounding factors such as variation
between precincts (neighbourhoods).

\hypertarget{ii-goals-relevant-issues-and-challenges}{%
\subsubsection{(ii) Goals, relevant issues, and
challenges}\label{ii-goals-relevant-issues-and-challenges}}

Our goal is to find out whether minorities (black and hispanic citizens)
are disproportionately targeted even when taking into account to
historic crime rates (approximated by arrest rates from the previous
year) and variances in precinct as a random effect. To do this, we take
the approach of modelling stop rates based on previous year's arrests,
categorized by ethnicity and crime type, while making precinct a random
effect in the sampling model. We then examine the coefficients of the
posterior distribution to see whether past year's crimes would affect
minority and white group stop rates in a similar way.

\subsubsection{(iii) Data source, cleaning, variables description, and
limitations in the
data}\label{iii-data-source-cleaning-variables-description-and-limitations-in-the-data}}

Our data source is the stop-and-frisk dataset compiled by Andrew Gelman
and Jennifer Hill in his book, and can be found
\href{http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/arm/examples/police/frisk_with_noise.dat}{at
this site}. It contains the times pedestrains are stopped in each of hte
75 precincts in New York City in 2005. We benefitted from his work and
hence no further cleaning is necessary. Every row is a precinct's number
of stops for a specific ethnicity and crime type, i.e.~one precinct's
total number of stops are spread across several rows. The following
variables are in the dataset:

\emph{Numerica variables:} stops: the number of stops for a specific
ethnicity and crime type, specified by crime and eth variables in the
same row pop: population of a specific ethnicity in the precinct
specified by the precinct variable in the same row past.arrests: the
number of arrests in the previous year for the ethnicity and crime type
specified by crime and eth variables in the same row

\emph{Factor variables:} precinct: numbered from 1-75 eth: 1=black,
2=hispanic, 3=white crime: 1=violent, 2=weapons, 3=property, 4=drug

\hypertarget{initial-eda-and-sampling-model-specification}{%
\subsection{Initial EDA and sampling model
specification}\label{initial-eda-and-sampling-model-specification}}

Since our data is count data, it is reasonable to use either the Poisson
or Negative Binomial distribution for the sampling model. We realized by
running quick summary statistics on response variable stop rate that
there is overdispersion, i.e.~the variance of 47254 is far greater than
the mean of 146. This gives us the idea that Negative Binomial
distribution is more appropriate to account for overdispersion factors.
We also do not have any zero values, so zero-inflated versions of
Poisson or Negative Binomial are not applicable. We validated this by
fitting a Poisson and Negative Binomial regression model with precinct
as the random effect, and by comparing the AIC/BIC it shows that indeed
the Negative Binomial is a much better model fit.

We also want to divide up the precincts by the portion of black
population in it, as we want to account for previous police claims that
relate to the demographics of a precinct. For example, police claim that
they are more likely to stop black pedestrians in the case where the
black pedestrian is in a predominantely white neighbourhood, and vice
versa. Hence, by categorizing precincts based on the proportion of black
population, we can use it to examine if disproportionate stopping of
minorities still exists in predominantely white or black neighborhoods.
Hence we created the variable \texttt{pblack} which categorizes
precincts with \textless{}10\%, 10-40\%, or \textgreater{} 40\% black
population.

Next, we want to incorporate the hiearchial element into the model, as
we have 3 different precinct categories (\textless{}10\%, 10-40\%, or
\textgreater{} 40\% black population) and 4 different crime types
(violent, weapons, property, drug). Previous literature has suggested
that police reports having different strategies for different precinct,
for example being more aggressive towards stopping pedestrains in high
crime precincts, or having higher stop rates because some crime types
are easier to spot than others. Hence, it is not ideal to do regression
without distinguishing effects of different precincts and crime types.
This calls for a hiearchial Negative Binomial program as follows:

\(\lambda\) = mean \(\alpha\) = over-dispersion factor

\[
\begin{eqnarray}
Y|\lambda, \alpha & \sim & NB(\lambda, \alpha)\\ 
\end{eqnarray}
\\
\lambda = Exp(x'\beta)
\]

\hypertarget{methodology-prior-posterior}{%
\subsection{Methodology (prior,
posterior)}\label{methodology-prior-posterior}}

As we adopt hiearchical Negative Binomial distribution as our sampling
model, there are 12 sampling models defined by different combinations of
3 precinct categories and 4 crime types. Setting prior distribution\\
\[
\begin{eqnarray}
\beta & \sim & \mathrm{N}(\overline{\beta}, A^{-1})\\
\alpha & \sim & Gamma(a,b)\\
\end{eqnarray}
\]

predictor (i.e.~every single factor the police considers when making a
stop), that would include factors like age and gender of the pedestrain
as well as many circumstantial cues.

controlled for precinct to precinct variation and crime type, but not
population and/or demographics. However, there is already plenty
literature that demonstrate that minority groups are stopped more oftan
even when taking into account their overall population, including
nuanced analysis done by taking into account day and mnight population
changes to account for commerical and business activity.

\#\#\#(iii) Exploratory Data Analysis

From the plots below, other than median income, all of our numeric
predictors appear reasonable with no extreme outliers that would
necessitate transformation. There are a few observations with median
income of around \$90,000, which is a large jump from around \$70,000
where the next highest observations are. We log-transform median income
to correct for the variable's skewed distribution.

We analyze the rates at which New Yorkers of differ- ent ethnic groups
were stopped by the police on the city streets, to assess the central
claim that race-specific stop rates reflect nothing more than
race-specific crime rates.

We address this question in several different ways using data on police
stops and conclude that members of minority groups were stopped more
often than whites, both in comparison to their overall population and to
the estimated rates of crime that they have committed.

When compared in that way, the ratio of stops to DCJS arrests was 1.24
for whites, 1.54 for blacks, and 1.72 for Hispanics; based on this
comparison, blacks are stopped 23\% more often than whites and Hispanics
are stopped 39\% more often than whites.

But suppose that the police make more stops in high-crime areas but
treat the different ethnic groups equally within any locality. Then the
citywide ratios could show significant differences between ethnic groups
even if stops were determined entirely by location rather than by
ethnicity. Because it is pos- sible that the patterns are systematically
different in neigh- borhoods with different ethnic compositions, we
divided the precincts into three categories in terms of their black
popula- tion: precincts that were less than 10\% black, 10--40\% black,
and more than 40\% black.

We conducted separate comparisons for violent crimes, weapons offenses,
property crimes, and drug crimes. For each, we modeled the number of
stops yep by ethnic group e and precinct p for that crime type, using as
a baseline the DCJS arrest count nep for that ethnic group, precinct,
and crime type.

For each fit, we simulated three several independent Markov chains from
different starting points, stopping when the simulations from each chain
alone were as variable as those from all of the chains mixed together
(Gelman(and Rubin 1992). We then gathered the last half of the simulated
chains and used these to compute posterior estimates and(standard
errors. For the analyses reported in this article, 10,000(iterations
were always sufficient for mixing of the sequences.
